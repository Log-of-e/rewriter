The repo is to host code for rewriting code, with eventual goal for just in time.

At this point this code is heavily based on and dependent on a fork of code from Zephyr at https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc, especially https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc/irdb-sdk and  sample cookbook code https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc/irdb-cookbook-examples.

  To run the code follow the cookbook instructions for using docker to contain all necessary dependencies [Zephyr IRDB cookbook](https://git.zephyr-software.com/opensrc/irdb-cookbook-examples)
